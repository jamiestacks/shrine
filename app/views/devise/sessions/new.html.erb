<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>
  Shrine was built in two weeks by a team of four people as a final project for Le Wagon's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
  The app was created for mobile first, and therefore will not render correctly when viewed on a desktop.
  Please take this into consideration when using the app.
  Thank you, and I hope you're able to make use of Shrine.
