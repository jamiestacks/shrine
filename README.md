### Grieving is hard. With Shrine, it's easier.

Shrine is a Ruby on Rails mobile-first application built to provide a platform for families and friends to come together around a lost loved one. 

#### A Home for Memories
* A Shrine is a dedication to a loved one, and serves as a place to share memories and experiences for all the people that were touched by their lives.
* Photos, videos and stories can be shared by anyone invited to a Shrine, bringing memories to life and teaching people things they never even knew about their loved ones.

#### Timeline
* Our landmark feature is the dynamic timeline that comes with each Shrine. Users can add Chapters to their loved one's timeline, which are then sorted chronologically to build out a full, community driven life story.
* Within each Chapter of a loved one's life people can add Stories, sharing the memories that they shared with your loved one throughout each period of their life.

#### Community
* Each Shrine has a dedicated chatroom, allowing users to talk in real time about certain memories and experiences that they have discovered through Shrine.
*  Any user can invite other people to a Shrine, continuously building out your loved one's community and encouraging more memories and stories to be shared.
